# AutoWatering
Java and Arduino-driven Auto-Watering System that measures the moisture levels in the soil to ensure that the plants receive the right amount of hydration timely.

Watering plants does not depend only on moisture level. When we take outdoor plants into consideration, we need to think about many factors that may affect the irrigation level such as humidity, temperature, and even the presence of sound level. In this project, the irrigation system has been improved based on the soil's moisture level, amount of the sunlight the plant is receiving & level of sound [Plants mainly respond to sound waves and that vibration helps their cells to move faster and produce more nutrients. When they receive that sound vibration, they need more water to make their food].
